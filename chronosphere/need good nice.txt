NEED TO HAVE:
-proper user interface!!
-moves working as intended (test and fix wind and whirl glitches) - Done, I think

-sounds: 
	wind sound (on push)
	laser and pulsar dmg sound
-toggle sound button (mute on/off)
-loop background music - DONE!!
-game over (death) screen
-help button (write down what needs to be on help screens!!)

-levels with appropriate rise in difficulty (without getting players freaked out with a difficulty jump)


GOOD TO HAVE:
-items to collect for points
-level completed message stating which level you have completed (text instead of graphics)
-game completed/death screen stating the level you reached and the score

NICE TO HAVE:
-sphere rotating when it moves (but only on user input moves, not on environmental moves!!)
-sphere exiting the level animation (add additional sprite for the wall next to the level exit, as it needs to be valid) -DONE
-animate the winds (phase1: display 1 arrow, phase 2: display 2 arrows, phase 3&4: display 3 arrows)
-separate buttons to move background music and other sounds


NOTES:
- make main starting screen where player can choose tutorial or normal levels
- help and audio settings could be accessed from that screen

-figure out what to do with places where aoe and lasers overlap
